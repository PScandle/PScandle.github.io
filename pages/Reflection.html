<h1>Ethical Reflection</h1>

<br>
<p>
    A key issue that is often raised around the principle of involving AI in difficult decisions, like using a
    self-driving car or involving robotics in a manufacturing process is the question of who would be at fault if
    something were to go wrong in the process. It seems like, at least at first when implementing AI within surgery,
    patients and their families may have a difficult time coming to terms with this as an issue. If complications
    arose due to a mistake made by a surgeon or another error that would be one thing, but having them be at the fault
    of an AI might be difficult for them to accept. At that point, the question of who would be at fault would arise
    too, and as such at this point I feel that for the application of AI in modern surgery to be successful, at least
    at first, it must only be used in addition to a competent surgeon or medical professional. This way, the
    practitioner is still in control of the process, simply receiving advice from the computer. This way, in the
    future when the technology is proven, complete AI takeover would be possible within surgery, when delivering
    drugs or any other time along the process. At this point, the wider population would likely be more comfortable
    with the proposition.

    <br>
    <br>

    Overall however, I believe the advancement of the AI field within modern surgery is a hugely positive process.
    It advances everything – providing further training and assistance to those new to the field as well,
    producing a hugely net – positive result in general.
