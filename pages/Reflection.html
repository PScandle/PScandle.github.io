<h1>Ethical Reflection</h1>

<br>
<p>
    Artificial Intelligence, or the intelligence demonstrated by machines (Shi, Yang, Yang, & Zhou, 2022) is a complex
    branch of computer science, concerned with attempting to replicate human-like intelligence within modern computers.
    It has revolutionized IT and has begun to drastically shape the way that modern society lives and functions.
    As the technology behind has matured, AI has been adopted further and further within many fields, from industrial
    manufacturing to autonomous navigation to medicine and surgery. It is the final point, surgery, that this assignment
    aims to address, first examining AI and its main components, next investigating the opportunities given to surgery
    using AI. Following this we will look to see both what choices it gives, as well as the risks posed by early adoption.
    Finally, we will present an ethical reflection of the topic.

<h2> Machine Learning </h2>

        Artificial Intelligence itself is broken up into multiple sub-topics, but there are three main ones that
        will be studied today. The first topic, Machine Learning, refers to the system’s ability to learn and merge
        new information learned through large scale observations, improving and extending it’s knowledge base
        autonomously rather than being directly programmed (Woolf, 2009). This directly facilitates self-improvement
        of the system, with experienced surgeons being able to assist in manually training the system to increase
        accuracy by noting any defects in automated analysis as they occur. major way that machine learning
        self-improves is through the tutor – student principle. Through this, the system takes in a large quantity
        of surgical examples, learning directly off surgeons – observing, evaluating, and analysing their actions,
        creating a pool of experience to draw from.

<h2> Neural Networks </h2>

            The next sub-topic of note is that of neural networks. Neural network models are one type of AI model that
            imitates how the human brain functions (Casas, 2020). They were first created to solve geographic issues
            in the 1990s but have recently flourished with modern advancements in computing power, data availability
            and AI technology (Casas, 2020). One of the main benefits to using a neural network as opposed to a
            different model is their strong ability to “detect complicated trends in high-dimensional datasets”
            (Guenther, 2001). Because of this, neural network models are of particular interest within the medicinal
            and surgical field, where data is complex and highly specific.

            Computer Vision is the final topic of interest. Here images are processed with the goal of extracting high
            level information (Brill, Erukhimov, Giduthuri, & Ramm, 2020). There are a number of noted uses for this,
            including in automotive applications, where work on advanced self-driving assistance systems and
            self-driving cars is progressing rapidly, surveillance applications, where face recognition is already
            accurate and well used, and the medical industry. Here, computer vision is widely used for a number of uses,
            including computer-aided diagnostics, image-guided radiation therapy and imaging genomics, among many other
            uses (Dey, Konar, De, & Bhattacharyya, 2021).

<h2> Wrap-up </h2>
<br>
These three fields barely begin to scratch the surface of what modern applications of artificial intelligence can
accomplish, but they serve as a suitable basis for this investigation. Each of these three fields have applications
that can aid surgical practice greatly, but their true strength comes in combination. This becomes particularly
apparent when looking at the nature of the data present within the medicinal industry – whereas AI often relies on
structured, repetitive data, medical data is highly unstructured and of a very high volume, the application of
traditional algorithms is still unproven. As such, a hybrid machine – intelligence system offers both a more robust
design as well as a significant increase in performance (Dey et al., 2021).
