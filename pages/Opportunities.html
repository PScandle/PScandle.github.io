<h1>Opportunities Presented</h1>

<br>
<p>
    Another important thing to investigate is the opportunities presented to surgery with further implementation of AI.
    There are a number of current opportunities that span across all phases of the surgery – from pre-operative
    screening of patients to identify tumours to real-time risk analysis and assessment for surgeons. There is also
    a huge scope for future opportunities, extending as far as offering robotic assistance for difficult surgeries.
    This could ultimately result in a lower failure rate for these difficult surgeries, making them more appealing and
    thus accessible, resulting in a greater standard of healthcare for the general population.

    <br>
    <br>

    AI has already been used for a while in the pre-operative phase of the surgical process. There are multiple
    solutions that have been investigated, including solutions focused around creating preoperative plans for
    orthopaedic surgery (Lambrechts, Wirix-Speetjens, Maes, & Van Huffel, 2022), risk-stratifying models for hospital
    patients (Kendale, 2022) and general surgical planning (Lambrechts, n. d.), utilising surgeon’s individual past
    operations to tailor plans to the individual surgeon. It is interesting to note that there has already been a high
    degree of accuracy improvements, and many of these algorithms are still in their infancy. There has been a ~40%
    reduction in the number of corrections required to be made to a pre-operative plan required for knee arthroplasty
    observed when the plan was created by AI rather than by the manufacturer (Lambrechts et al., 2022). A >10%
    increase in implant size accuracy was observed when an AI created plan was used as against the manufacturer’s
    recommendation also (Lambrechts et al., 2022).

    <br>
    <br>

    Risk analysis is another area within which AI solutions have already been developed (Hospital, n. d.). Amongst
    other things, current solutions are aimed to assist surgeons with decision making, counselling and outcome
    prediction (Hospital, n. d.). Another feature of these tools is their accessibility for medical staff, with many
    of them offering smartphone applications to ease access where possible.

    <br>
    <br>

    A future opportunity that AI is looking to fulfil is the opportunity to perform robotic surgery. This has already
    been implemented with robotic assistance in mildly invasive surgery, resulting in a noticeable reduction in both
    surgical trauma and recovery time (Kwo, 2021). Having proved the effectiveness of robotic surgical assistance,
    the next goal is to scale the principle up – utilising robotics to assist in performing difficult surgeries,
    like keyhole or gastro-intestinal surgery. In January 2022, researchers succeeded in performing keyhole surgery
    on a pig without human help (Gregory, 2022). Furthermore, this was done to a higher standard than a human surgery,
    producing “significantly better results” (Gregory, 2022).
