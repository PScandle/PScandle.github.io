<h1>Choices Offered by AI</h1>

<br>
<p>
    Artificial Intelligence, or the intelligence demonstrated by machines (Shi, Yang, Yang, & Zhou, 2022) is a complex
    branch of computer science, concerned with attempting to replicate human-like intelligence within modern computers.
    It has revolutionized IT and has begun to drastically shape the way that modern society lives and functions.
    As the technology behind has matured, AI has been adopted further and further within many fields, from industrial
    manufacturing to autonomous navigation to medicine and surgery. It is the final point, surgery, that this assignment
    aims to address, first examining AI and its main components, next investigating the opportunities given to surgery
    using AI. Following this we will look to see both what choices it gives, as well as the risks posed by early adoption.
    Finally, we will present an ethical reflection of the topic.

    <br>
    <br>

    Having explored the opportunities presented by Artificial Intelligence within modern surgery, it has become
    clear that it presents a number of choices for practitioners of modern surgery. As is outlined in the
    opportunities section above, there are a number of applications that surgeons and practitioners can take
    advantage of throughout the surgical process – ranging from pre-operative applications through to
    peri-operative and post-operative products also.

    <br>
    <br>

    The majority of the pre-operative choices that are given involve choosing to take advantage of a solution or
    not. In the orthopaedic scenario given above, if the practitioner decided to adopt an AI created treatment plan
    over the manufacturer’s provided on, they would typically see a significant increase in accuracy, with a
    notable decrease in corrections required in the plan (Lambrechts et al., 2022). Another choice practitioners
    are now given is the opportunity to utilise AI-powered tumour detection software (Radiology, 2022). This gives
    surgeons who may be inexperienced a chance to use this to learn from, offering a more accurate diagnosis as
    well as offering a simple way for more experienced surgeons to get a second opinion on their diagnosis.

    <br>
    <br>

    There are a couple of peri-operative choices that are given. As mentioned in the ‘Opportunities’ section,
    one option involves future use of robotic surgical assistants to either assist or perform surgical operations
    on patients. Further investigation into automated drug delivery, anaesthesia prediction and monitoring of
    surgical complication has been conducted (Solanki et al., 2021), resulting in the practitioners again
    having the choice to either utilise automated delivery or control anaesthetic and other drug distribution
    manually.

    <br>
    <br>

    The final choice of note in this report is the ability to seek robotic assistance within the practice. As
    mentioned above, robotic assistance is progressing at a great rate, and as such in the near future robotic
    assistance, particularly with difficult surgery such as gastrointestinal or keyhole surgery, will become
    commonplace. There are advantages to taking advantage of this assistance – from current trials it is seen
    that robotic surgery has both a lower error rate and a higher recovery speed. There are downsides naturally –
    any errors that may occur during the robotic surgery can be of unforeseen consequence, and it can reduce the
    demand for particularly skilled surgeons, but on the whole, from an outside perspective, it seems that this
    would be a significant step forward in the realm of surgical treatment.
