<h1>CTiS: Impact of Technology Site - AI Within Surgery</h1>

<h2> Team 1213 - Peter Scandle </h2>
<h3> Semester One 2022 </h3>

    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence, or the intelligence demonstrated by machines (Shi, Yang, Yang, & Zhou, 2022) is a complex
        branch of computer science, concerned with attempting to replicate human-like intelligence within modern computers.
        It has revolutionized IT and has begun to drastically shape the way that modern society lives and functions.
        As the technology behind has matured, AI has been adopted further and further within many fields, from industrial
        manufacturing to autonomous navigation to medicine and surgery. It is the final point, surgery, that this assignment
        aims to address, first examining AI and its main components, next investigating the opportunities given to surgery
        using AI. Following this we will look to see both what choices it gives, as well as the risks posed by early adoption.
        Finally, we will present an ethical reflection of the topic.
